    \item suggestion for a suitable model order for a linear model (based on a linearization of the model)
    \item motivation for suggested model order.
    \item \textsc{Matlab} codes for the required functions.
    \item one plot for the spectrum of the binary random signal for the required values of $\alpha$.
\end{itemize}
Hint: This section should fit in 1-2 pages. You don't need to explain theory here.

\section{Models}
This section should include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item descriptions of model structures used. (You should use more than one structure.)
    \item motivation for choice of model order for each model structure.
    \item plots of Bode diagrams, poles and zeros.
    \item analysis/interpretations of plots.
   \item validation performed with simulation (\texttt{compare} with \texttt{M=inf}) and correlation analysis (\texttt{resid}).
   \item analysis/interpretations of validation and correlation analysis.
   \item a comparison between the accuracy of models obtained with different input signals (binary random signals v/s uniformly distributed white noise)
   \item  a ranking of estimated models with respect to how well they describe the process, along with a rigorous motivation of chosen ranking. (Compare the analysis of plots, validation and correlation analysis for the different models.)
